This is a coding-along with a book <i>Modern Full Stack Development</i> by F. Zammetti.

Although, some minor issues and misleads as well as not-up-to-date info are normal for any technical book which is 3 years old, this book is full of it. I wouldn't recommend it.

There is some useful overall explanation on tools, but not proper practical examples.

I stopped MailBag development as there were no real SMTP / IMAP servers to test on.

Note to myself for future references, if I'd like to continue: stopped at page 233 (of pdf), Chapter 9.
